# Gitman — version control for this repo

Run **every** version-control action through `gitman` (inside the devenv shell). Raw
`jj`/`git` edits break canonicity and force a `gitman reconcile`.

## Scope & coordination

gitman owns **version control only**. For cross-phase, cross-manager ordering across the
repo's whole lifecycle (spec → scaffold → change → verify → save → docs), defer to the
`repoman` skill — the repoman entrypoint sequences the managers and routes the VC steps
here. Within version control, gitman is authoritative.

## Bootstrapping a repo

`gitman init --colocate` is the one-command front door: it colocates jj onto this directory's git —
**adopting** an existing `.git` (importing its history, keeping uncommitted work on `@`) or creating
a fresh one — and then freezes trunk. Pick the path by repo state:

- **Existing git repo with history** (e.g. an "Initial commit" + uncommitted edits):
  ```
  gitman init --colocate --trunk main     # adopts the .git; trunk reuses the existing branch
  gitman start <name>                      # adopts the uncommitted work into a lane
  gitman save -m "<message>"
  ```
  No `seed` needed — trunk already has a commit.

- **Fresh / empty repo** (no commits yet):
  ```
  gitman init --colocate --trunk main      # creates the colocated git + trunk bookmark at @
  gitman seed -m "Initial commit"          # describes the working copy as trunk's first commit
  ```
  `seed` is one-shot and refuses once trunk has any history.

(Without `--colocate`, `gitman init` assumes the workspace is already colocated; if it isn't, it
tells you to colocate first.)

## The lane loop

A **lane** is one unit of work: a named bookmark (= git branch) on trunk, kept linear.

```
gitman start <name>         # begin a lane (add --workspace to isolate it in its own dir)
# ...edit files...
gitman save -m "<message>"  # describe the current change
gitman status               # see trunk + all lanes (canonical or off-canonical)
gitman sync                 # fetch trunk + rebase this lane onto it
gitman publish              # push the lane (branch = lane name); verify hook runs first
gitman land [<lane>...]     # fold lane(s) into trunk, advance trunk, retire the lane(s)
gitman abandon [<lane>]     # discard a lane
```

## Safety net

- **`gitman undo`** reverts the last intent (whole-intent, via jj's op-log).
  `gitman undo --list` shows recent ops; `gitman undo --op <id>` restores any of them.
- **`gitman resolve [--list]`** surfaces conflicts. Conflicts are *not* blocking — keep
  working and resolve later (jj records conflicts in commits).
- **`gitman reconcile`** is the one recovery path when `status` says OFF-CANONICAL: it
  adopts stray changes into lanes (or `--abandon` discards them).

## Versioning

```
gitman version                       # show current version
gitman version bump <major|minor|patch>
gitman release [<level>|--version X.Y.Z]   # (bump →) tag vX.Y.Z → push tag
```

This repo's version lives at: not configured — add a [version] section to gitman.toml to enable version/release

## Exit codes

`0` ok · `1` a VC decision is needed (conflict / push rejected / verify blocked /
off-canonical) · `2` infra/config · `3` invalid usage. Pass `--json` for structured output.
